# projects
For my stockprediction project since its a machine learning project make sure the user has all the libraries like numpy, panda, matplotlib installed
if its not can install from command prompt by using pip install .

You need to also have django and mysql.

To run the project you have to open cmd make sure the path which displays is stored there for example C drive so
Cd stockprediction
python manage.py runserver --nothreading --noreload
you will get a link link and open that.
